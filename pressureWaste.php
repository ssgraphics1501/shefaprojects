<span style="text-align:justify">A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially different from the ambient pressure. The pressure differential is dangerous, and fatal accidents have occurred in the history of pressure vessel development and operation.<br />
<br />

To maintain our quality management system, safe design and fabrication, we have received various Explosive Equipments certificates from the authorized Explosive Departments.
